## Description
In ghana children are named according to the dayof the week they were born. 
Don't worry I know you probably dont remember the day, leave that to us.
#

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* You need Internet to generate your Akan name
* You will also need to input your gender
* Lastly you will need to input your date of birth
#
## Behavior Driven Development
This is how I broke down the problem statement to come up with this Amzing Application:

* User would need to Input date of birth and gender - through forms (html input)
* Computer could read and store the data inputed. - I used JavaScript functions and variables to make this happen.
* Check if the date entered is valid
* Alert the user if input is invalid
* Return the day once date is inputed
* Use arrays to store the akan names for each gender.
* Use control flows to determine the output according to gender and day generated.
* Output the akan name generated.

Extra actions I desired my application to perform were:
* Automatically reset Form if the input was invalid.
